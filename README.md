### Installation

To use or further develop this project, NPM, Gulp and some additional plugins are required. After you clone this repository, you'll need to set them up.



### Building from source

Even though a pre-compiled version is available in the `/dest` directory of this project, you might want to compile it yourself. Inside of the project's directory on your local machine use a following command:

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production gulp build
```

Keep in mind this command is meant for production environments. Using it strips away sourcemaps and minifies source files.

### Development

If you desire to make changes to the project, use Gulp in development mode. It includes processing of HTML, CSS and JS files with a Browsersync server for hot-reloading.

Inside of the project's folder use this command:


```sh
$ gulp serve
```
